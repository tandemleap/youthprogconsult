              <p>
                I ran SPARK — a youth-serving program in Ashland, WI — for years. I know what it's
                like to be the person responsible for grant reports who also had to lead
                afterschool, supervise staff, manage community relationships, and keep the
                lights on.
              </p>
              <p>
                The consulting work I do now comes from that experience — not from a framework
                I read in a book, not from theory. I've built the systems I recommend. I've
                done the data pulls I'm asking you to simplify. I've had the conversations
                with funders that require you to actually know your numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I work with organizations because I genuinely believe good youth-serving programs
                are worth preserving — and too many of them are struggling with back-end systems
                that weren't built to support the front-end work.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I bring isn't a methodology. It's practitioner credibility, a
                systems-builder mindset, and enough distance from your day-to-day to see
                what you can't see when you're inside it.
